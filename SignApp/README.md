The application implements user registration, authentication, and secure account
management using Java Servlets, JSP, JDBC, and design patterns.

## Project Context

- Application architecture (MVC)
- Java Servlets and backend logic
- DAO layer using JDBC
- User authentication and session management
- Password security using BCrypt
- Email verification and password recovery
- Use of design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder)
- WAR packaging and deployment on Apache Tomcat 9

## Team Contributions
Other team members supported with:
